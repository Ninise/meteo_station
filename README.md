# Arduino Weather station

I'm building an Arduino weather station, currently it has:
- DHT11 temp and humidity sensor;
- LCD display to show the data.

I plan to add:
- Waterdrop sensor to check if it's raining;
- Solar panel to check if is it cloudy or sunny;
- CO2 sensor for the air check;

Libraries used:
- LiquidCrystal.h
- DHT.h
